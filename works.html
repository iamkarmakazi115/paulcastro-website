                                Kael Thorne's twenty-fifth birthday was supposed to be ordinary—dinner with family, maybe a call from his sister. Instead, it becomes the night his parents die and a supernatural assassin called the Hunter comes to claim what flows in his veins.

Thrust into a war between supernatural races, he must forge unlikely alliances with exiled Fae warriors, battle-scarred trolls, storm-wielding djinn, and vengeful banshees—all while learning to master the beast within.

The son of Hades should be ruling the underworld, but he's chosen the mortal world instead, finding peace in the arms of Elena Martinez, an art history student who sees past his supernatural nature.
